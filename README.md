A few days ago I came across [Henry Wang](https://twitter.com/henrywangnl)❜s ❝[ggplot2 Theme Elements Demonstration](https://henrywang.nl/ggplot2-theme-elements-demonstration/)❞ on Twitter and thought it was such a smart way to refer to the theme elements in `ggplot2` (check it out if you haven't already!). Since I always customize my plots, every time I make one I end up having to google the [list of theme elements](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/theme.html). In an attempt to minimize the time spent doing that, I decided to make my own version of Henry's demonstration for myself, using the theme elements I frequently use and tweak.

I also made a PDF version so that it's easy to copy-paste the code. In case it would be useful to anyone else, feel free to download it or the PNG version from this repository or my [website](https://isabella-b.com/blog/ggplot2-theme-elements-reference).

I included a part in the sheet where I said ❝Set `minimal` as the baseline theme❞ since I always do this, but of course that's just my personal workflow.

There are *many* more theme elements that you can set and inheritances available, so be sure to check them out in `ggplot2`'s [documentation](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/theme.html)!
